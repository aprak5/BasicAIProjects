# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CSC 411) Projects

## Overview

All the projects below are developed using Eclipse and Java, so make sure Eclipse and Java/JDK are installed with the latest version. 

- Problem Set 1 was developed using a DFS (Depth-First Search) Algorithm with the goal to clean at least 60% of all squares (orange is dirty and gray is clean).
- Problem Set 2 was developed using a A* Search Algorithm with the goal to get to the destination square with the fewest squares navigated (shortest path).
- Problem Set 3 was developed using a Simulated Annealing Algorithm with the goal to get the best configuration among the workers and the tasks.
- Linear Programming uses linear programming instead of Simulated Annealing to solve the same problem.
- Problem Set 4 uses a Minimax Algorithm (with Alpha/Beta pruning) to beat an adverserial robot in the popular game Connect Four.
- Problem Set 6 uses a D-Separation Algorithm with an established evidence base to come to a logical conclusion using dependencies/causalities.

All the projects below are developed using SWI-Prolog and Prolog, so make sure SWI-Prolog and Prolog are installed with the latest version. 

- Problem Set 5 was developed using predicate logic principles to create a movie recommendation engine.
